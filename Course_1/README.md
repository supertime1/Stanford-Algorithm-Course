# Divid and Conquer, Sorting and Searching. and Randomized Algorithms
## Week 1
### Introduction  
  - Recursive Algorithm
  - Karatsuba Multiplication
  - Merge Sort: 
    - use recursive tree to analysis NOP
    - the upper bound turns out to be: 6n x log2(n+1)
  - Guiding Principles
    - Worst case analysis, as opposed to average-case analysis and benchmarks
    - Won't pay much attention to constant factors, lower-order terms
      - way easier
      - constants depend on architecture/complier/programmer anyways
      - lose very little predictive power
    - Asymptotic analysis
      - focus on running time for large input size n 
### Asymptotic analysis
  - High-level idea: suppress constant factors and lower-order terms
  - Big-O, Big-Omega, Big-Theta definition
